# ReactCognitoProxyServer

- Run with `npm run dev`
- You need to obtain oauth credentials from GCP to use google Drive routes
- You need to create a cognito user pool on AWS and add all the credentials in a .env file.
The `env.example` file shows the structure of the `.env` file.
- The project also has a v2.1 collection file that you can import to postman to test the APIs. The file is named `CognitoProject.postman_collection.json` .
